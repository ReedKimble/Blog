## Evolution as Iteration

This post introduces a short paper titled **“Evolution as Iteration: A Protodomain Account of Constrained Continuation.”**

The paper does not propose a new theory of evolution, nor does it attempt to generalize or replace biological accounts. It does not argue that complexity must increase, that systems improve over time, or that evolution is progressive.

Instead, it repositions *evolution* structurally.

At the protodomain level, evolution is not defined by genes, selection, reproduction, or adaptation. Those are domain-specific implementations. When such mechanisms are set aside, what remains is a minimal and recurring structure: systems that **iterate on themselves while retaining the consequences of prior states**.

In this usage, evolution names what occurs when iteration includes persistence. Earlier states constrain later ones, introducing irreversibility without intention and direction without destination. History matters—not because it is remembered, but because it cannot be undone without removing accumulated constraint.

Evolution, in this sense, does not move toward a goal. It proceeds only along paths that remain coherent under what has already occurred.

### The Paper

The full paper is available in the repository here:

**[Evolution as Iteration — Paper](https://github.com/ReedKimble/Blog/blob/2d2bd8327b5bb805e35e06e2336190562bfb4782/assets/papers/Evolution%20As%20Iteration.pdf)**

(Placement in the repository reflects stability, not priority. The document may be revised, replaced, or removed as understanding sharpens.)

### Relationship to Other Writing

This paper is compatible with other work on coherence, processing grammar, fate, and truth, but it does not require familiarity with that material. It is intended to place a concept cleanly, not to explain mechanisms or defend conclusions.

If the framing feels obvious rather than novel, that is the point. What remains after incoherence is removed rarely announces itself as discovery.

Nothing more is required.
