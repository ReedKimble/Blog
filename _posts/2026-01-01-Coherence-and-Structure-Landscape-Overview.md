## Coherence and Structure: A Landscape Overview

This post introduces a short paper titled **“Landscape Overview: Coherence and Structure Across Domains.”**

The paper arose from a simple observation: searching for work on *coherence* and *structure* consistently surfaces a wide range of academic, technical, and popular writing that uses the same language while speaking about fundamentally different things.

In linguistics, coherence describes intelligibility of text. In psychology, it names consistency of self or belief. In physics, it refers to stable patterns. In philosophy, it becomes a criterion for justification. In popular writing, it often appears as alignment or mirroring between self and reality.

None of these uses are wrong. They are simply *local*.

The difficulty appears when language that belongs to one layer is asked to do work at another. Coherence becomes a goal rather than a constraint. Structure becomes a model rather than a prerequisite. Insight becomes identity. Explanation becomes authority. These are not moral failures; they are layer failures.

The purpose of the Landscape Overview paper is to place these uses relative to one another without adjudicating them. It does not argue against existing disciplines or attempt to unify them under a single theory. Instead, it identifies a consistent structural gap: very little work treats coherence as a precondition for existence itself, or structure as a grammar that must already hold before any domain-specific description is possible.

This gap explains why genuinely structural work often appears out of place—mistaken for abstraction, spirituality, or philosophy—while domain-local work dominates keyword searches. The difference is not quality or rigor. It is *layer*.

### Relationship to the Corpus

This paper functions as a map rather than a contribution of new structure. It explains why adjacent work often feels close but incompatible, and why attempts to integrate coherence and structure across disciplines frequently collapse into epistemology, identity, or metaphor.

Within the broader corpus, the Landscape Overview sits alongside other meta-documents such as the Corpus Entry and Reader Guide. It does not require familiarity with formal grammars, theology, or implementations. Its role is descriptive: to clarify the terrain in which structural inquiry currently appears.

If the description resonates, it is because the misalignment has already been encountered elsewhere. If it does not, nothing is lost by leaving it unread.

Nothing more is required.
