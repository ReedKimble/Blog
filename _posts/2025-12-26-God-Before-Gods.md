This post introduces a short paper titled **“God Before Gods: Coherence, Constraint, and the Origin of Divinity.”**

The paper proposes a reversal of a common modern assumption: that gods were invented primarily as explanations for natural phenomena early humans could not yet describe.

Instead, the paper treats the earliest concept of **God** as structural rather than explanatory — not as a cause of events, but as a name given to a coherence attractor: a set of constraints humans discovered they could not violate without suffering fragmentation, collapse, or violence.

Under this framing, religion is not primitive science. It is early constraint discovery — a long, costly process of observing which patterns of human behavior preserve coherence across individuals, communities, and generations.

The paper further argues that:

* polytheism can be understood as early domain separation rather than superstition,
* monotheism functions as compression rather than innovation,
* and modern critiques of religion often misidentify God as an explanation when the original function was restraint.

The argument does not require belief, doctrine, or metaphysics. It rests entirely on historical pattern recognition and structural reasoning.

### Relationship to Other Writing

This paper is compatible with other work on coherence, constraint, fate, stewardship, and protodomain reasoning, but it does not require familiarity with that material.

It is intended to place a concept cleanly, not to persuade.

If the framing resonates, it is because the constraints already hold.

Nothing more is required.
