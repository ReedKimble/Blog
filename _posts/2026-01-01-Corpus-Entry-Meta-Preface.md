## Corpus Entry (Meta-Preface)

This post introduces a short paper titled **“Corpus Entry: Meta-Preface and Reader Guide.”**

Unlike most documents in this corpus, this paper does not introduce a new concept, invariant, or structural claim. It exists to clarify posture.

As the body of work expanded—eventually exceeding hundreds of pages across formal papers, interpretive lenses, and public implementations—it became clear that no single document could serve as a natural starting point without distorting the work itself. The corpus was never meant to be read linearly or consumed in full. It was meant to be *entered*, observed where coherence holds, and left freely when it does not.

The Corpus Entry document was created to meet that need. It does not summarize the corpus, explain its conclusions, or provide a recommended reading order. Instead, it establishes what the corpus *is and is not*, and offers several non-privileged entry paths depending on the reader’s background and intent.

In this sense, the document functions as an interface rather than a foundation. It makes no claims of authority, introduces no new dependencies, and remains downstream of nothing. Its purpose is simply to prevent misalignment at first contact.

### The Paper

The full paper is available here:

**[Corpus Entry: Meta-Preface and Reader Guide — Paper](https://github.com/ReedKimble/Blog/blob/dd1a5841464ae1866b7028e88ec2b4c5ea6730b8/assets/papers/!_Corpus%20Entry_%20Meta%E2%80%91preface%20And%20Reader%20Guide.pdf)**

(Placement in the repository reflects orientation, not priority. The document may be revised, replaced, or removed as the corpus evolves.)

### Relationship to the Corpus

This document sits alongside the corpus rather than within it. It does not replace any README, paper, or blog post, and it does not claim to unify the work under a single explanation.

Instead, it preserves three constraints that have governed the corpus from the beginning:

* No domain is privileged over another.
* No reader posture is required.
* No closure is imposed at entry.

Readers may approach the corpus through formal structure, theology, philosophy, code, or simple curiosity. The entry document exists only to ensure that whichever door is chosen, it opens without force.

If the document is useful, it will clarify how to approach the work without requiring commitment. If it is not, it can be ignored without loss.

Nothing more is required.
