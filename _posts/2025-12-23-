## Ideal States

This post introduces a short paper titled **“Ideal States.”**

The paper does not describe goals, values, or prescriptions. It does not argue for what should be pursued, optimized, or preferred. Instead, it places the concept of an *ideal state* structurally, as something that appears repeatedly across systems when coherence is preserved.

In this usage, an ideal state is not an endpoint or aspiration. It is an attractor: a configuration toward which a system reliably settles once misapplied constraints are removed and external forcing is minimized.

The paper treats ideal states as descriptive rather than normative. What appears stable, desirable, or aligned is not the result of intention or optimization, but of a system no longer fighting itself.

### The Paper

The full paper is available in the repository here:

**[Ideal States — Paper](../Assets/Papers/Ideal-States.md)**

(Placement in the repository reflects stability, not priority. The document may be revised, replaced, or removed as understanding sharpens.)

### Relationship to Other Writing

This paper is compatible with other work on coherence, invariants, constraints, and truth, but it does not require familiarity with that material. It is intended to stand on its own as a semantic placement rather than an instructional guide.

If the description resonates, it is because the structure already holds.

Nothing more is required.
