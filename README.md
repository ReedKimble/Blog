# A Grammar of Structure — Blog

This repository contains interpretive and exploratory writings related to *A Grammar of Structure*.

The posts here are not foundational documents.
They do not establish the ontology, formal grammar, or structural constraints of the corpus.
They operate downstream of those commitments, offering language-level, experiential, and
cross-domain ways of encountering the same underlying structure.

This repository exists as an entrance surface.

Readers may arrive here without prior exposure to formal material.
Posts may be read selectively, out of order, or in isolation.
No agreement, adoption, or completion is assumed or required.

The writing here is intentionally non-prescriptive.
It does not aim to persuade, instruct, or resolve.
Its purpose is to make certain structural relationships *recognizable* without requiring
formalization.

Other repositories present the same work under different postures.
This repository does not replace them, and it does not stand above them.

If something here resonates, it is because the structure it names was already operative.
If it does not, nothing further is required.
